   <div class="indexH3"><h3> What does it mean to "Eat the Rich"?</h3> </div> 
    <div class="indexP"><p>‚ÄúEat the Rich‚Äù is commonly attributed to Jean Jacques Rousseau, a renowned political philosopher and 
           leading figure in the French Revolution. The original quote goes like this: ‚ÄúWhen the people shall 
           have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rich‚Äù that Rousseau was referring to was anyone 
           in power.</p></div>

   <div class="indexH3"><h3> Why we say "Eat the Rich"</h3> </div> 
       <div class="indexP"><p>Though we are not living in the time of the French Revolution, the sentiment stays the same. The problem 
            is the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. According to Pew Research, ‚Äúthe wealth 
            gap between America‚Äôs richest and poorer families more than doubled from 1989 to 2016.‚Äù And since COVID 
            this problem has only been exacerbated. Filthy rich people like Jeff Bezos have gained $23 billion since 
            the start of COVID whereas with the rest of Americans 25% of adults say that they or someone in their 
            household has lost their job. And more than 220,000 people have died.
