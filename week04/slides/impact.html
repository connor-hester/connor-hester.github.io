       <h4>"Relativity" by M.C. Escher </h4>
       <p>In 2015, the third installment of the "Night at the Museum" trilogy, "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"" 
           chose to use Escher's "Relativity" as inspiration for their movie poster and scenes. One scene features 
           characters running around a set based on "Relativity."" </p>
       <p>"Relativity" has been used as inspiration for many bodies of work in the film industry. Out of Escher's many works, 
           it is the most directly and indirectly influential piece in popular culture, including movies, cartoons, video games 
           and even an unofficial LEGO version.</p>
	   <h4>"Labyrinth" (1986) </h4>
	   <p>In this movie, Jim Henson's musical features an adventure about a young girl saving her younger brother from the Goblin King. 
           This film features a stairwell based on "Relativity" in the film's most climactic scene. Alongside, a copy of the image "Relativity" 
           can also be found on the main character's bedroom wall.</p>
