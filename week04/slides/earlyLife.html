         <p>Maurits Cornelis Escher was born on June 17, 1898, in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, to Sarah and 
             George Escher. As a child, he hated school but enjoyed his drawing classes. </p>

        <p>He barely passed high school but he successfully entered Haarlem's School for Architectural and 
            Decorative Arts, originally for architecture. Escher decided to take up graphic arts under the 
            recommendation of his mentor, Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. </p>

        <p>Escher traveled to the Mediterranean in the early 1920s and was profoundly influenced by the wonders 
            of the Moor-designed Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. He met Jetta Umiker in 1923; they married 
            the following year, going on to have three children: George, Arthur, and Jan. </p>

        <p>By 1929, his work had grown in popularity and demand and he had held a number of exhibitions in Holland 
            and Switzerland. During this time Escher began to experiment with ideas of metamorphosis presenting an 
            object turning into something completely different and he would return to these ideas in his later work. </p>

        <p>Between 1930 and 1940 the Eschers moved around Europe often, from Switzerland to Belgium to Holland back to 
            the Netherlands. At this point, Escher's works were wildly popular worldwide and some of the most iconic pieces 
            of his life. M.C. Escher died on March 27, 1972, in a retirement community, in Laren, Netherlands </p>
