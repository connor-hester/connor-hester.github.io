             <h4>Albrecht Durer</h4>
             <p>Famous printmaker. Interested in Humanist and Realist art style. One of his best known pieces is "The Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse".</p>

             <h4>Hieronymous Bosch</h4>
                <p>One of the first artists of Surrealist art. Did very biblical pieces. One of his best known pieces is "The Seven Deadly Sins".</p>

            <div class="influence">
             <h4>Dada</h4>
             <p>The focus of the artists was not on crafting aesthetically pleasing objects but on making works that often upended bourgeois 
                 sensibilities and that generated difficult questions about society, the role of the artist, and the purpose of art.</p>

             <h4>Cubism</h4>
                <p>Cubists explored open form, piercing figures and objects by letting the space flow through them, blending background into foreground, 
                and showing objects from various angles. </p>

             <div class="influence">
             <h4>Surrealism</h4>
             <p>In Surrealism, each artist relied on their own recurring motifs arisen through their dreams or/and unconscious mind. At its basic, the 
                imagery is outlandish, perplexing, and even uncanny, as it is meant to jolt the viewer out of their comforting assumptions. 
                Built upon Dadaist ideals. </p>
