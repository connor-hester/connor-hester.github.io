        <div id="first"><p>The way that we send and receive information is more important than the information itself</p></div>
        <div id="second"><p>Where we were once consumers, consuming information by watching television or listening to the radio,
             in the 21st century we have now also become producers, creating our own information as well. </p></div>
        <div id="third"><p>The mediums change the way we behave, news stories replaced with tweets, conversations replaced with emojis</p></div>
        <div id="fourth"><p>Luhan said, “It is impossible to understand social and cultural changes without a knowledge of the workings of media.” 
            This is especially true today, evidenced by the protests of this past summer being organized entirely online/on social media. </p></div>
        <div id="fifth"><p>McLuhan prophesied that “Electrical information devices for universal, tyrannical womb-to-tomb surveillance are causing 
            a very serious dilemma between our claim to privacy and the community’s need to know.” We now know that surveillance is conducted on every 
            person in great detail. </p></div>
        <div id="sixth"><p>In McLuhan’s world, he refers to “One big gossip column that is unforgiving, unforgetful and from which there is no redemption”. 
            This is seen today frequently and has brought us our golden rule of the internet: Once you put something out there it stays out there forever. </p></div>
